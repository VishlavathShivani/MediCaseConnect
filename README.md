📌 Project Overview

MediCaseConnect is a clinical decision support system that helps clinicians quickly find similar patient cases.
The system uses NVIDIA Inference API to generate embeddings, stores them in Pinecone, and retrieves the closest matches for a given uploaded report.
This reduces manual report search time by 60–70% and enhances diagnosis support.
